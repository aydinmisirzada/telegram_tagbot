## TagBot for Telegram groups.

Whether you're about to start a game with your friends in telegram, or discuss important topics with your colleagues, you might need to tag your groupmates. 
> Why do I need this bot if I can tag the groupmates myself?

Tagging yourself is all good, until it comes to a large number of people. It may also happen that you forget to add someone to your taglist, and this is the very situation where the tagbot might come in handy.

### How it works?
Here are 3 very simple steps:
1. Add the bot to your Telegram group (@invisibletagbot)
2. Ask your groupmates to add themselves to the taglist via `/add` command. They should also start the bot privately in order to get notified.
3. Tag them via `/tag` command

### Why is the bot "invisible"?
The bot has nothing to do with invisibility, just a cool username :smile:
